# Watch Tower

A self-hosted observability and monitoring dashboard for Laravel applications, built on **Laravel 13**, **Inertia v3**, **React 19**, and **Tailwind v4**. Watch Tower receives telemetry from your apps via [Laravel Nightwatch](https://nightwatch.laravel.com) and gives you a single place to investigate errors, traces, queues, schedules, mail, logs, and more.

---

## What it does

Watch Tower ingests events from one or more client Laravel applications and groups, fingerprints, and visualizes them. The dashboard surfaces:

- **Error tracking** — grouped error occurrences, fingerprinting, comments, and resolution workflows
- **Performance traces** — request traces with database query breakdowns
- **Outgoing HTTP requests** — every external request your app makes
- **Queue jobs** — successful, failed, and retried job runs
- **Scheduled tasks** — historic runs of `php artisan schedule:run`
- **Cache events** — hits, misses, writes, and forgets
- **Mail sends & notifications** — every email or notification dispatched
- **Logs** — application log entries, searchable in-app
- **Metrics** — custom numeric metrics over time
- **Multi-tenant** — organizations and projects, so multiple apps and teams share one Watch Tower instance

## Installation

There are two pieces to install — the Watch Tower server, and the Nightwatch client inside each app you want to monitor.

- **[Install Watch Tower (server)](doc/install.md)** — full setup guide: requirements, environment, database, dev server, scripts, testing, and troubleshooting.
- **[Install the client app integration](doc/install-client.md)** — wire up `laravel/nightwatch` in your client Laravel app and point it at your Watch Tower instance.

### Quick start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> watch-tower
cd watch-tower
composer run setup
composer run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000**.

For anything that fails or needs explanation, see [doc/install.md](doc/install.md).
